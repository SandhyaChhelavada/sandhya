                <p>When you invest, you choose what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to impact your financial welfare negatively.</p>
                <p>The primary purpose of the risk-profiling process is to ensure that the investment decisions you make are in sync with your financial status, personality, circumstances, and goals.</p>

                    <h3><img src="icon1.png" alt="Icon 1"> What will your Report tell you?*</h3>
                    <p>Your risk report breaks down your risk profile in terms of Risk Need, Risk Awareness, Risk Tolerance, and Risk Ability. This will help you to understand your Risk Persona accurately, how much of a risk taker you are and how much you can afford to be. It also gives you a suggested investment policy.</p>

                    <h3><img src="icon2.png" alt="Icon 2"> How will your Report help you?*</h3>
                    <p>Your risk report will give you an indication of the return you require (Required Rate of Return) to achieve your financial goals. Whether you are saving enough, what risk you take in proportion to the required rate of return, and what adjustments you might need to make in your current spending pattern or your financial goals.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3><img src="icon3.png" alt="Icon 3"> How to use your report?*</h3>
                    <p>By referring to this report, you will primarily understand your risk persona. Accordingly, you can improve some aspects of your understanding and knowledge of investment-related risks. Choose the right asset mix and investment products based on the net worth you're aiming for. Review your income, expenses, and net worth graphs to fine-tune your goals.</p>

            <h3>What is the Required Rate of Return (RRR)?</h3>
            <p>This is the post-tax return you require on your present and future savings such that you can meet all your financial goals. It should ideally not exceed 11%. If it does, you should consider revisiting your expenses and goals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>What is Risk Need?</h3>
            <p>The magnitude of risk which is necessary for you to take to achieve your financial goals. It is derived from the Required Rate of Return. The higher the required rate of return, the higher the need for risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>What is Risk Ability?</h3>
            <p>By nature, investments in equities require a long-term horizon. We have assumed a minimum of five years. Hence, ideally, your next five-year net outgoes should get funded by liquid investments. The higher the proportion of five-year net outgoes getting funded by equities, the lower your risk ability - and vice versa.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Risk Score</h3>

            <p>Your Risk Score is derived from your Risk Need and Risk Tolerance and leads to your suggested investment structure. Higher the Risk Score, the higher the allocation to equities.</p>
